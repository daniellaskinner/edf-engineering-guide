# Hi from the Small Business Acquisition and Retention Squad

We reside within the Small Business and Commercial Tribe in the Solutions and Automation area at EDF. We currently have three sibling squads in the Small Business and Commercial Tribe, which are:

- Small Business Service
- Propositions & Commissions
- Data Enablement

## Purpose

We take care of two applications that help EDF sell energy to small business customers. I tend to think of independent pubs, hairdressers and MMA gyms :D

We have an applications such as a tool that serves to support salespeople at EDF use in calling up small businesses to sell them energy quotes; and a public facing web app that the small businesses themselves use to generate an energy quote.
