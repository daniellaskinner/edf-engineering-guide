### How we Point Tickets in Refinement

We give story points to user stories and bugs, but not spikes. The pointing system we use is Fibonnacci numbers.

**1** - a change involving no logic like a text change.
**2** - a small change in one area of the codebase (i.e just the back end) involving some logic
**3** - a smallish feature involving both front end and back end.
**5** - medium feature involving both front end and back end.
**8** - complex feature involving both front end and back end.
**13** - break it down into smaller stories
